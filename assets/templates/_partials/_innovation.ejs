      <p class="lead">
        This project aims to continue the development of the Thermal Shield- a passive thermal insulation solution that protects temperature sensitive products (such as SNF) during transportation and storage.
      </p>

      <p>
        In 2016/2017 a Mercer University student team developed a small-scale model of the Thermal Shield and performed tests to this scaled model. Based on these testing results, the UNHRD LAB in conjecture with the student team at Mercer University think this could be a viable solution to shipping temperature sensitive products.

      <p>
        The next step of this project is to garner the needed materials to begin construction of the full-scale prototype. Following this step, tests will be performed regarding thermal efficiency and durability. Based on these tests, the UNHRD LAB will determine which parts of the solution need to be modified in order to create the best possible solution. After making these adjustments, further field testing will need to be completed. After completing this process, the final design will be determined. This solution will then be ready to be implemented during the transportation and storage of all temperature sensitive products, such as SNF. This solution will be communicated to all HRD locations and the humanitarian community in order to improve the quality of temperature sensitive products, and in turn, improve the health and welfare of individuals around the world.

        The goal of this project is to create a ready-to-go accommodation and office kit for first   responders to transport and construct during the first days of an emergency.
      </p>
      <p>
        During 2016, UNHRD LAB finalized the development of a ready to go accommodation and office kit for the first responders to soon be tested in a sudden emergency. UNHRD will store the first two units in Brindisi and Dubai, and plan to preposition them in the remaining Hubs as well, to enable a more prompt/standardized procedure when responding to emergency. The next step of this project will be to test the prototype in the next emergency. First responders will use this kit to perform all necessary activities for three months. Based on this test, the UNHRD LAB will determine what parts of the solution need to be modified in order to create the most optimal first response kit.

        The prototype will then be adjusted based off of these discoveries regarding: power supply, quality, performance, and practice. Therefore, the new kit will be updated with a self-sustainable power supply after the design and prototyping time frame. The design will be tested once more in the field. After going through this process, a final solution will be determined. This solution will then be ready to be implemented in all future emergencies, and it will be communicated to all HRD locations and the humanitarian community alike.
